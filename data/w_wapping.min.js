When the docks were first redeveloped in the 19th Century they were designed to create as much dockside space as possible. The two linked basins (East and West) are both accessed via an entrance lock from the Thames. Steam engines kept the water level in the basins about four feet above that of the tidal river. The docks were also specially designed so that the warehouses were built right on the quayside so that goods could be unloaded directly into them. This was to try to reduce stealing and pilfering between the ship and warehouse. The docks were opened on 25th October 1828. Although well used, the docks were not a great commercial success and were unable to accommodate large ships. The docks were badly damaged during WWII and all the warehouses around the eastern basin were destroyed, and the site remained derelict until the 1960s. The docks were formally closed in 1968, with redevelopment taking place in the early 1970s. Tower Hotel, which forms one corner of the front dock, was opened in 1973.</p>",access:"",audio_direction:"assets/aud/dir/WTT1-2.mp3",audio_talk:"",image:"wap/DickensInn202208.jpg",video:"",quiz:"2",lat:"51.5065469",lon:"-0.0718432",questions:{q1:"001-What predominant goods were imported into the dock, that it was most famous for, in the 19th Century?
